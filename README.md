## Features
- **Real-time prices**. Real-time prices of your preferred stocks, cryptocurrencies, and forex rates.
- **Market status indicator**. Displays the stock market's current status (Left of the stock symbol).
- **History chart**. Ticker's value change over the past day.
- **Company & Crypto Logos**. Display a logo in place of the history chart.
- **Currency selection**. Select the currency you would like to see prices on. Check the list of supported currencies 
[here](matrix/README.md).

## Installation
### Hardware
Materials needed:
- Raspberry Pi (Tested on 3B+ and 4B, but should work in other models)
- RGB LED Matrix. [Supported sizes](matrix/coords/README.md):
  - 32×16
  - 64×32
  - 128×64
- Adafruit RGB Matrix [HAT] or [Bonnet] (Optional. Matrix can be connected directly to GPIO pins)

### Software
**Pre-requisites**

You'll need to make sure Git and PIP are installed on your Raspberry Pi, as well as Python 3.9+.

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git python3-pip -y
```

**Installation**

First, clone this repository. Using the `--recursive` flag will install the rgbmatrix binaries, which come from
hzeller's [rpi-rgb-led-matrix] library. This library is used to render the data onto the LED matrix.

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/feram18/led-stock-ticker.git
cd led-stock-ticker
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

**Updating**

From the `led-stock-ticker` directory, run the update script. The script will also take care of updating all 
dependencies.

```sh
./update.sh
```

## Usage
### Configuration
A `config.json.example` file is included for reference in the `matrix` directory. After installation has been completed, 
run the configuration script to set your preferences.

```sh
./config.py
```

The `config.json` file follows the following format:
```
  "tickers":                      Options for stocks and cryptocurrencies preferences
    "stocks"          Array       Pass an array of stock symbols
                                  Example: ["TSLA", "AMZN", "MSFT"]
    "cryptos"         Array       Pass an array of cryptocurrency symbols
                                  Example: ["BTC", "ETH", "LTC"]
    "forex"           Array       Pass an array of forex pairs
                                  Example: ["USD/EUR", "EUR/JPY", "GBP/USD"]
                                  
  "options":                      Other miscellaneous preferences
    "currency"        String      Currency in which to display prices
                                  Example: "EUR" (Default: USD)
    "clock_format"    String      Sets the preferred clock format
                                  Accepted values are "12h" and "24h" (Default: 12h)
    "date_format"     String      Sets the preferred date format
                                  (Default: "%a, %b %d" - eg. Fri, Jan 14)
    "update_rate"     Integer     Rate at which data is fetched/updated (in minutes)
                                  (Default: 10min)
    "rotation_rate"   Integer     Rate at which tickers will rotate (in seconds)
                                  (Default: 10sec)
    "show_logos"      Boolean     Display company stock & cryptocurrency logos in place
                                  of history charts. (Default: false)
```

Additionally, you will want to ensure the timezone on your Raspberry Pi is correct. It will often have London by 
default, but can be changed through the Raspberry Pi configuration tool.

`Localisation Options > Timezone > [Your Time Zone]`

```sh
sudo raspi-config
```

### Flags
The LED matrix is configured with the flags provided by the [rpi-rgb-led-matrix] library. 
More details on these flags/arguments can be found in the library's documentation.

```
--led-rows                Display panel rows. (Default: 32)

```

### Execution
From the `led-stock-ticker` directory run the command

```sh
sudo python3 main.py --led-gpio-mapping="adafruit-hat" --led-slowdown-gpio=2
```
Modify and include [flags](#Flags) as needed for your particular setup. Running as root is necessary in order for the 
matrix to render. Privileges are dropped after initialization.

Additionally, you can [create a `systemd` service](https://github.com/feram18/led-stock-ticker/wiki/Create-Systemd-Service) to manage the application.

### Debug
If you are experiencing issues, enable debug messages by appending the `--debug` flag to your execution command, logs are 
written to the `led-stock-ticker.log` file.
